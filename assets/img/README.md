# Copy Vault - Image Assets

Place your Copy Vault images in this directory:

## Required Images

### 1. App Screenshot (`app-screenshot.png`)

- **Purpose**: Main hero screenshot showing the Copy Vault app interface
- **Recommended size**: 2400x1600px or similar high-resolution
- **Format**: PNG with transparency (if needed) or JPG

### 2. Mac App Store Badge (`app-store-badge.svg`)
- **Location**: `assets/img/app-store-badge.svg`
- **Purpose**: Download button linking to Mac App Store
- **Download from**: [Apple Marketing Resources](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/)

## Optional Images

### App Icon
The current layout includes an SVG placeholder icon in the hero section. You can:
- Replace it with your actual app icon image
- Keep the SVG icon and customize its appearance
- Update the gradient colors in `_layouts/landing.html` (line 26-27)

## Image Guidelines

- Use high-resolution images (2x or 3x for Retina displays)
- Optimize images for web (compress without losing quality)
- PNG for screenshots with transparency
- SVG for icons and badges when possible
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 500KB for screenshots)
