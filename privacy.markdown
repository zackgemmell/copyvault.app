**Effective Date:** November 2, 2025

Copy Vault ("the App") is developed by Zack Gemmell. This policy explains how your information is handled when you use Copy Vault on macOS and its companion app on iOS.

---

## 1. Overview

Copy Vault is a clipboard history manager that allows you to securely save, view, and reuse items you copy on your device. Your privacy is our top priority. The App is designed to function entirely on your device, without collecting, transmitting, or storing any personal data externally.

---

## 2. Information We Do Not Collect

- **No Personal Data:** Copy Vault does not collect, store, or share any personal information such as your name, email address, or payment details.
- **No Clipboard Content Transmission:** Clipboard entries are stored locally on your device and are never transmitted to any server controlled by the developer or third parties.
- **No Analytics or Tracking:** Copy Vault does not use analytics tools, tracking software, advertising identifiers, or crash reporting frameworks that collect personal data.

---

## 3. Optional iCloud Sync

If you enable iCloud Sync, your clipboard history is securely stored in your private iCloud account using Apple's CloudKit technology.

- The data remains under your Apple ID and is not accessible to the developer.
- Apple's [Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/) governs all data stored in iCloud.
- Disabling iCloud Sync will stop synchronization and remove cloud copies as controlled by your Apple settings.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

All clipboard data is stored locally on your device (and optionally in iCloud). Your data is never shared, sold, or transmitted to any external server. The App uses standard Apple sandboxing and system-level protections to help secure your information.

---

## 5. Third-Party Services

Copy Vault does not integrate with or rely on any third-party analytics, advertising, or data-collection services.

---

## 6. Children's Privacy

Copy Vault does not target or knowingly collect any data from children under 13 years of age.

---

## 7. Changes to This Policy

If this policy changes, an updated version will be posted within the App and on any associated website. The effective date at the top will reflect the latest revision.
